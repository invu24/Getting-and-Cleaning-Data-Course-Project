# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This is the project involved in the 4th week of the Getting and Cleaning Data course using R.

Refer to the run_analysis.R file to find the code involved with tidying the data. 

The first step involves downloading and unzipping the data set.
Make sure to read all of the necessary data frames into R and rename the text files as you please.
Once you have located the data and are in the correct working directory, the following instructions are to be used:

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Don't forget to load dplyr from your library in order for the code to work properly.

The second independent tidy data text file is called tidy_data_2 and is subsequently the final output for this project.
